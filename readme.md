# Learning_GO
## Intro

Since about the Fall of 2015, I've wanted to get into Go. After almost four years,
I'm starting to move into it. I want to learn a more serious language than my
scripting languages such as Python, PHP and JavaScript. I did take a class in C++
but I really did not like that language. One activity which I will be doing to
learn Go is by working through the small book, from Pragmatic Programmers, called
Exercise for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills. The code,
for that book, will be found in the challenges section.
